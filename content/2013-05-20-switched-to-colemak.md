We have over 20 alternative layout keyboardists at Automattic circa this post, including [one rather well known one](http://ma.tt/2003/08/on-the-dvorak-keyboard-layout/). For three years, I resisted their proselytizing as I calculated the cost/benefit ratio to be against switching:

- We live in a [QWERTY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY) world. I didn't like the idea of being "that guy" when I sat down in front of someone else's computer.
- I didn't want the hassle of radically shifted keyboard shortcuts.
- I thought it generally over optimizing (for most people). Sixty or seventy words per minute seemed fine to me as it ought to keep pace well enough with most mental threads.

I ended up changing my mind because:

- **It's not about the (potential) speed.** I work at a keyboard _the majority of my waking hours_. My chances of eventual [RSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetitive_strain_injury) are high and [QWERTY doesn't help](http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#What.27s_wrong_with_the_QWERTY_layout.3F). I've finally gotten through my thick head that the main benefit of an alternative layout is comfort and hopefully injury prevention.
- The advent of the [BYOD trend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYOD) made the "QWERTY world" problem less of an issue.
- The Colemak layout leaves the main QWERTY shortcuts intact.

Most of my coworkers switched to [Dvorak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard). I've switched to Colemak as I think it to be [a tad more efficient](http://colemak.com/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#What.27s_wrong_with_the_Dvorak_layout.3F). The important takeaway, IMO, is to get off QWERTY as either should be leaps better on your wrists over time.

If you are intrigued, join me in making a Colemak switch! You can grab the purdy-fied Colemak printout you see above from my coworker [Matt Wiebe](http://mattwie.be/)'s site [as a PDF](http://somadesign.ca/2012/learning-colemak/).

<small>Yes, I did type this post up in Colemak. As I'm only a couple days in, it took me, erm, awhile.</small>
