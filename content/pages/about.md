Hey, I'm **@mhs**. I'm interested in:

- Software Engineering
- Robust Tools (Elixir, Rust, Web Components)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Simple Platforms (Bare metal servers)
- Software Security

I'm currently taking a sabbatical before diving into my next adventure. In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, music, and trying to keep up with the kiddos. I thrive when building robust, sustainable, human-centric products. On this blog I write about things I'm building and general topics I'm interested in.
