Hey, I'm **@mhs**. I'm interested in:

- Software Engineering
- Robust Tools (Elixir, Rust, HTML/CSS, Web Components)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Simple Operational Flows
- Essential Complexity, not Incidental Complexity

I'm currently taking a sabbatical before diving into my next adventure. In my spare time I enjoy working on side projects, contributing to open source, all things music, and trying to keep up with the kiddos. I thrive when building robust, sustainable, human-centric products. This site serves as a platform for me to share missives with you, lucky reader, on topics that interest me.

## Site Details

This site is built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in Rust. The theme is a ~hacky mess~ fork of [Kita](https://github.com/st1020/kita) which I'm calling Makita for now.
